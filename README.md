# AI & Cybersecurity

This repository showcases our comprehensive laboratory work for the **"AI and Cybersecurity"** course at Politecnico di Torino. 

Our coursework comprises four distinct laboratory experiments, each targeting specific AI paradigms and their practical deployment within cybersecurity frameworks.

## Laboratory Experiments
### ðŸ”¹ Lab 1 â€” Deep Learning Approaches to Network Security Classification
**Dataset**: `dataset_Lab1.csv` - Network traffic intrusion dataset

Developed and optimized multi-layer perceptrons to classify network threats using traffic features. Focused on data preprocessing and tuning for accurate detection of legitimate traffic, credential attacks, DDoS, and port scans.

### ðŸ”¹ Lab 2 â€” Sequential Pattern Recognition for Malware Analysis  
**Datasets**: `dataset_train_Lab2.json`, `dataset_test_Lab2.json` - API call sequence collections

Applied statistical and neural sequence models to identify malicious API call patterns. Compared term-frequency methods with deep learning for sequential malware analysis.

### ðŸ”¹ Lab 3 â€” Computational Linguistics for Cyber Forensics
**Datasets**: `cyberlab.csv`, `train.json`, `test.json` (contained in `Dataset_lab3.7z`)

Used computational linguistics to classify command-line sessions and detect attack patterns. Built systems to recognize suspicious terminal activities and recurring forensic behaviors.

### ðŸ”¹ Lab 4 â€” Unsupervised Pattern Discovery for Threat Detection
**Datasets**: `dataset_train_Lab4.csv`, `dataset_test_Lab4.csv` - Network anomaly detection datasets

Employed unsupervised learning, including SVM variants and clustering, to find anomalies in network traffic. Detected irregular behaviors without labeled data to identify potential threats.
